# Augentic

**au·gen·tic** *(adj.)* /ɔːˈdʒɛn.tɪk/ — **intent-preserving AI augmentation**: hand-crafted
software systems enhanced or extended (by tools, systems, or context) **without losing the
“real” essence**.

**Augentic** is focussed on the integration of AI, automation, and developer tooling to **amplify
capability without distorting provenance, authorship, or ground truth**.

Build sophisticated systems by leveraging the multiplying effect of agentic software delivery, 
all while retaining human care and ownership.

## What we care about

- **Safety**: built on [Wasmtime], the WebAssembly runtime provides strong isolation and
  sandboxing.
- **Performance**: we use Rust to build fast, efficient, and reliable software.
- **Verifiability**: designed around the inclusion of "humans in the loop", each step in the
  process of transforming requirements into working software is verifiable.
- **Craftsmanship**: with a hand-crafted runtime plane, Augentic provides a safe and reliable
  foundation for generated business logic, and a strong foundation for building sophisticated
  applications.
