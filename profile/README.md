## Augentic

**au·gen·tic** *(adj.)* /ɔːˈdʒɛn.tɪk/ — **intent-preserving AI augmentation**: hand-crafted software systems enhanced or extended (by tools, systems, or context) **without losing the “real” essence**.

**Augentic** is focussed on the integration of AI, automation, and developer tooling to **amplify capability without distorting provenance, authorship, or ground truth**.

We build systems where agents contribute leverage, but humans retain ownership:

- **Human-owned outcomes**: you stay accountable; changes are understandable and reviewable.
- **Intent-preserving assistance**: the tool helps, but doesn’t rewrite goals, invent facts, or “take the wheel.”
- **Traceable augmentation**: key claims and changes can be tied back to sources, inputs, and decisions.

## What we care about

- **Provenance**: key outputs are attributable (sources, lineage, and “why this”).  
- **Control**: explicit actions, predictable changes, easy rollback.  
- **Verifiability**: checks, tests, and guardrails around generated work.  
- **Alignment**: constraints reflect real intent (policies, style, specs, reality).

## What you’ll find here

Open-source building blocks and experiments in **augentic** systems: tools that make work **faster and more capable**, while staying **traceable, verifiable, and aligned**.

## Working with us

If you’re building assistance that should be **high leverage, low hallucination, audit-trails-by-default**, you’re in the right place.
