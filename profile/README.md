# Augentic

**au·gen·tic** *(adj.)* /ɔːˈdʒɛn.tɪk/ — **intent-preserving AI augmentation**: hand-crafted
software systems enhanced or extended (by tools, systems, or context) **without losing the
“real” essence**.

**Augentic** is focussed on the integration of AI, automation, and developer tooling to **amplify
capability without distorting provenance, authorship, or ground truth**.

Build systems where agents contribute leverage, but humans retain ownership:

- **Human-owned**: you stay accountable; changes are understandable and reviewable.
- **Intent-preserving**: the tool helps, but doesn’t rewrite goals, invent facts, or “take the
  wheel.”
- **Traceable**: key claims and changes can be tied back to sources, inputs, and decisions.

## What we care about

- **Safety**: built on [Wasmtime], the WebAssembly runtime provides strong isolation and
  sandboxing.
- **Performance**: we use Rust to build fast, efficient, and reliable software.
- **Verifiability**: designed around the inclusion of "humans in the loop", each step in the 
  process of transforming requirements into working software is verifiable.
- **Craftsmanship**: the runtime plane is hand-crafted to provide a safe and reliable foundation
  for generated business logic.

## What you’ll find here

Open-source building blocks for building software using **agentic augmentation**. Tools to help
humans build software **faster, safer, and for a lower cost**, without sacrificing **traceable,
verifiable, and maintainable** code.

## Working with us

If you’re building assistance that should be **high leverage, low hallucination, 
audit-trails-by-default**, you’re in the right place.
